# FRC (Better Name Pending)

The goal of this project is to create a game that allows users to play FRC as if it were a video game similar to xRC sim or Mosim. Unlike these existing projects, I would like to add ai controlled robots to comepete with or against you preforming both offence and defence. I am also considering trying to implement multiplayer, but that is lower down on the todo list.
